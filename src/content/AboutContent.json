  "text": "Transfer credit articulation is among the most inefficient, opaque, and frustrating processes in all of higher education. UnBlockEd takes an innovative approach using Blockchain technology and curricular analytics. Our goal is to make an end-to-end system for transfer credit recognition in higher education, creating an open transfer exchange that will dramatically improve the efficiency of the transfer processes and empower students with additional control over their learning records. There are benefits to universities, too. The technology can replace the manual and painstaking process of credit transfer, and data-empowering interoperability means greater efficiencies across all university systems."
