UnBlockEd takes an innovative approach using Blockchain technology and curricular analytics. Our goal is to make an end-to-end system for transfer credit recognition in higher education, creating an open transfer exchange that will dramatically improve the efficiency of the transfer processes and empower students with additional control through control over their learning records. Additionally, universities benefit by replacing the manual and painstaking process of credit transfer. Data-empowering interoperability means greater efficiencies across all university systems"
