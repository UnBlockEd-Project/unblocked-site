  "text": "Historically marginalized student populations are among the most vulnerable students in post-secondary education. They transfer in more hours which don't apply to their degree programs, resulting in longer times to graduation and greater debt. When combined with inefficient and ambiguous transfer credit processes, the result is a significantly inequitable outcome for such students. Blockchain technology combined with curricular analytics offers a more transparent transfer process resulting in fewer “lost” credit hours and increased student agency, ultimately improving student graduation rates."
